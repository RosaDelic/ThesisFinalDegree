STDFnetwork implemented in Matlab

This simulation generates 8 files containing all the data generated by the execution. Some parameters are necessary to understand the data stored in the files, such as:
    * nNeurons: Represents the number of neurons considered for the simulation
    * neq: Number of equations needed to describe one neuronal model
    * nvar: Total number of equations needed to describe the network Nxneq
    * N: number of time steps considered to integrate the network (t_f-t_0)/h
The following files are saved during the simulation:
    (1) ti.mat: Contains the variable ti, of size N, representing the time of the simulation. Contains the timesteps from $t_0$ to $t_f$ with a discretization $h$.
    (2) w_matrix.mat: Contains the variable wi_matrix, of size Nxnvar containing the time evolution of all the variables of the neurons in the network.
    (3) prelAMPA_matrix.mat: Contains the variable prelAMPA_matrix, of size NxnNeurons, containing the time evolution of the probability of release associeted to the AMPA neurotransmitter in the case of depression
    (4) prelNMDA_matrix.mat: Contains the variable prelNMDA_matrix, of size NxnNeurons, containing the time evolution of the probability of release associeted to the NMDA neurotransmitter in the case of depression
    (5) prelGABA_matrix.mat: Contains the variable prelGABA_matrix, of size NxnNeurons, containing the time evolution of the probability of release associeted to the GABA neurotransmitter in the case of depression
    (6) pRel_stfAMPA_matrix.mat: Contains the variable pRel_stfAMPA_matrix, of size NxnNeurons, containing the time evolution of the probability of release associeted to the AMPA neurotransmitter in the case of facilitation
    (7) pRel_stfNMDA_matrix.mat: Contains the variable pRel_stfNMDA_matrix, of size NxnNeurons, containing the time evolution of the probability of release associeted to the NMDA neurotransmitter in the case of facilitation
    (8) pRel_stfGABA_matrix.mat: Contains the variable pRel_stfNMDA_matrix, of size NxnNeurons, containing the time evolution of the probability of release associeted to the GABA neurotransmitter in the case of facilitation
