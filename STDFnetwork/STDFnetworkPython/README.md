STDFnetwork implemented in Python with Numba

This simulation generates one unique file containing all the data generated by the execution. Some parameters are necessary to understand the data stored in the files, such as:
    * nNeurons: Represents the number of neurons considered for the simulation
    * neq: Number of equations needed to describe one neuronal model
    * nvar: Total number of equations needed to describe the network $N\times neq$
    * N: number of time steps considered to integrate the network $(t_f-t_0)/h$
The file is named fDDnumber_fFFnumber.npz where Dnumber and Fnumber represent the depression and facilitation factor, respectively. The following variables are saved inside this main file:
    (1) ti: Contains the variable ti, of size N, representing the time of the simulation. Contains the timesteps from $t_0$ to $t_f$ with a discretization $h$.
    (2) wi: Contains the variable wi_matrix, of size $nvar\times N$ containing the time evolution of all the variables of the neurons in the network.
    (3) pRelAMPA: Contains the variable prelAMPA_matrix, of size $nNeurons\times N$, containing the time evolution of the probability of release associeted to the AMPA neurotransmitter in the case of depression
    (4) pRelNMDA: Contains the variable prelNMDA_matrix, of size $nNeurons\times N$, containing the time evolution of the probability of release associeted to the NMDA neurotransmitter in the case of depression
    (5) pRelGABA: Contains the variable prelGABA_matrix, of size $nNeurons\times N$, containing the time evolution of the probability of release associeted to the GABA neurotransmitter in the case of depression
    (6) pRel_stfAMPA: Contains the variable pRel_stfAMPA_matrix, of size $nNeurons\times N$, containing the time evolution of the probability of release associeted to the AMPA neurotransmitter in the case of facilitation
    (7) pRel_stfNMDA: Contains the variable pRel_stfNMDA_matrix, of size $nNeurons\times N$, containing the time evolution of the probability of release associeted to the NMDA neurotransmitter in the case of facilitation
    (8) pRel_stfGABA: Contains the variable pRel_stfNMDA_matrix, of size $nNeurons\times N$, containing the time evolution of the probability of release associeted to the GABA neurotransmitter in the case of facilitation
    (9) exec_time: Time it took to run the simulation
