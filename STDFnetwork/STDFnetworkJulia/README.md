STDFnetwork implemented in Julia

This simulation generates one unique file containing all the data generated by the execution. Some parameters that are necessary to understand the data stored in the files, such as:
    * nNeurons: Represents the number of neurons considered for the simulation
    * neq: Number of equations needed to describe one neuronal model
    * nvar: Total number of equations needed to describe the network $N\times neq$
    * N: number of time steps considered to integrate the network $(t_f-t_0)/h$
The file is named fDDnumber_fFFnumber.mat where Dnumber and Fnumber represent the depression and facilitation factor, respectively. The following variables are saved inside this main file:
    (1) ti: Of size N. Represents the time of the simulation. Contains the timesteps from $t_0$ to $t_f$ with a discretization $h$.
    (2) wi: Of size $N \times nvar$ containing the time evolution of all the variables of the neurons in the network.
    (3) pRelAMPA: Of size $N\time nNeurons$, containing the time evolution of the probability of release associeted to the AMPA neurotransmitter in the case of depression
    (4) pRelNMDA: Of size $N\time nNeurons$, containing the time evolution of the probability of release associeted to the NMDA neurotransmitter in the case of depression
    (5) pRelGABA: Of size $N\time nNeurons$, containing the time evolution of the probability of release associeted to the GABA neurotransmitter in the case of depression
    (6) pRel_stfAMPA: Of size $N\time nNeurons$, containing the time evolution of the probability of release associeted to the AMPA neurotransmitter in the case of facilitation
    (7) pRel_stfNMDA: Of size $N\time nNeurons$, containing the time evolution of the probability of release associeted to the NMDA neurotransmitter in the case of facilitation
    (8) pRel_stfGABA: Of size $N\time nNeurons$, containing the time evolution of the probability of release associeted to the GABA neurotransmitter in the case of facilitation
